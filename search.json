I have experience as a private tutor, learning assistant, college instructor, and more recently, I have led computational workshops. Through these experiences, I have worked with students across many educational levels, backgrounds, and talents. Being a student myself has also given me the ability to relate to my students and has broadened my perspective of education, while granting me the opportunity to develop my own teaching style: Using technology and data to enhance student engagement and encourage them to become critical thinkers that can solve real-world problems."

    "text": "Data-Driven approaches for urban disaster risk reduction\nAs the demand for applied mathematicians increases in interdisciplinary research, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Dr. Jorge León (UTFSM, Chile) in tsunami evacuation projects, which I first began in 2019 while pursuing my master’s degree. Chile is one of the most seismic countries in the world, and I truly believe that with this unique challenge, I can contribute to society with my expertise, create collaborations and explore new research areas. My two main topics of interest here are ABM for urban disasters evacuation, and machine learning explainability for decision-making. The projects I have been involved in require a wide variety of skills, such as geo-data science, agent-based models, statistics, applied mathematics and machine learning."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

My primary research is on applications and analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). I feel that I do not fit the typical archetype of a mathematician, as I am not only passionate about contributing to the field and academia, but also to society.\nDuring my doctoral studies, I have been developing novel PINNs models applied to infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Particularly, I am interested in accounting for human behavior in the modeling, including mobility, vaccination or interventions. My strong foundation in mathematics, statistics and computer science has given me the tools to work in theory and numerical applications."
