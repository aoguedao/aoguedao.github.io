:::{#hero-heading}

My name is Alonso, and I am currently pursuing my PhD degree under the supervision of [Dr. Padmanabhan Seshaiyer](https://math.gmu.edu/~pseshaiy/) at George Mason University, USA. My primary research is on applications and analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). I feel that I do not fit the typical archetype of a mathematician, as I am not only passionate about contributing to the field and academia, but also to society.

During my doctoral studies, I have been developing novel PINNs models applied to infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Particularly, I am interested in accounting for human behavior in the modeling, including mobility, vaccination or interventions. My strong foundation in mathematics, statistics and computer science has given me the tools to work in theory and numerical applications.
